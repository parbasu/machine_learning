    "Many things behave very differntly in high-dimensional space.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you pick a random point in a unit-square, it will have only about a $0.4$% chance of being located less than $0.001$ from a border. But in a $10000$-dimensional unit hypercube, this probability is greater than $99.9999999%$. Most points in a high-dimensional hypercube are very close to the border.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pick two points randomly in a unit square, the distance between these two points will be, on average, roughly $0.52$. If you pick two random points in a unit $3$D, the average distance will be roughly $0.66$. But what about two points picked randonly in a $1000000$-dimensional hypercube? Well, the average distance, will be about $408.25$. This is quite counterintuitive: how can two points be so far apart when they both lie within the same unit hypercube? This fact implies that high-dimensional datasets are risk of being very sparse: most training instances are likely to be far away from each other. Of course, this also means that a new instance will likely be far away from any training instance, making predictions much lesss reliable than in lower dimensions, since they will be based on much larger extrapolations. In short, the more dimenisions the training set has, the greater the risk of overfitting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, one solution to the curse of dimensionality could be increase the size of the training set to reach a sufficient density of training instances. Unfortunately, in practice, the number of training instances required to reach a given density grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. With just 100 features (much less than in the MNIST problem), you would need more training instances than atoms in the observable universe in order for training instances to be within $0.1$ of each other on average, assuming they were spread out uniformly across all dimensions.\n"
